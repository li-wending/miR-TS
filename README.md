# miR-TS
This repository archives the pipeline to generate the miRNA-based Tissue Signal (miR-TS) scores.

miR-TS is designed to use plasma/serum small RNA read counts data to estimate the tissue-specific signals for 23 tissue types, including:

 adipocyte, artery, bladder, bone, bowel, brain, esophagus, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph_node, muscle, nerve, pancreas, pleurae, salivary_gland, skin, spleen, stomach, testis, thyroid, vein.

The expected input is a read count matrix of miRNAs × samples, the expected output is a miR-TS score matrix of samples × tissue types.

A demo example of small RNA data on hepatitic C is also included.
