# miRNA-Based Tissue Signal (miR-TS) scores

## What is miR-TS?

**miR-TS**, a computational method to estimate signals from 23 tissue types using circulating miRNAs in plasma/serum, can simultaneously track multiple tissue health and predict the onset of a wide range of diseases.

## Input & Output

- **Input:** A matrix with **miRNAs as rows** and **samples as columns**
- **Output:** A matrix with **samples as rows** and **tissue types as columns** (miR-TS scores)

## Tissue types being estimated
*adipocyte, artery, bladder, bone, bowel, brain, esophagus, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph_node,
muscle, nerve, pancreas, pleura, salivary_gland, skin, spleen, stomach, testis, thyroid, vein*

## Demo Data

This repository includes a demo dataset based on small RNA data from a hepatitis C study (GEO accession: GSE74872).
It demonstrates how to apply the miR-TS pipeline and illustrates how liver miR-TS scores varies across three groups: healthy controls, hepatitis C patients without fibrosis, and those with fibrosis.
