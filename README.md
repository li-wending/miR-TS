# miR-TS
This repository archives the pipeline to generate the miRNA-based Tissue Signal (miR-TS) scores.
miR-TS is designed to estimate from plasma/serum small RNA read counts data the tissue-specific signals for 23 tissue types: 
  bladder, lymph_node, muscle, salivary_gland, spleen, testis, adipocyte, artery, bone, esophagus,
  skin, stomach, kidney, liver, nerve, lung, heart, bowel, brain, pancreas, pleurae, thyroid, vein.

The expected input is a data matrix of miRNAs × samples, the expected output is a matrix of samples × tissue scores.

A demo example of hepatitic C small RNA data is also included.
